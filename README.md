**Forecasting Project for Econ 307: Forecasting**

This project forecasts total retail sales data in Canada. In the project, I used Python and Eviews. I went through multiple iterations of the project before handing in a simple AR(1) model with a trend component. Because the model type was limited to ARMAX due to the assignment constraints, I used macro-economic trend analysis from my personal life to evaluate a one-step-ahead forecast. For this project, I won an in-class competition for the most accurate forecast out of all other students' forecasts.
